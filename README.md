# E-Commerce Product Service

This project is a **learning microservice** built with Spring Boot and PostgreSQL as part of a hands-on exploration of microservice architecture and best practices.

It demonstrates:
- Clean layered architecture (DTO, Service, Repository, Controller)
- REST API design with Spring Boot
- Database migrations with Flyway
- Docker containerization (planned)
- Service discovery with Eureka (upcoming)
- Secure communication with JWT (upcoming)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** This is a demo/learning project and **not intended for production use** without further enhancements.
